          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;What is myChEMBL?</h4>
          <p>myChEMBL is a completely open platform, which combines public domain bioactivity data with open source web, database and cheminformatics technologies. myChEMBL consists of a Linux (Ubuntu) Virtual Machine featuring a PostgreSQL schema with the latest version of the ChEMBL database, as well as the latest RDKit cheminformatics libraries.</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;Why should I use myChEMBL?</h4>
          <p>myChEMBL is a free and open platform aimed at anyone interested in drug discovery, cheminformatics and bioinformatics. Some reasons why you might want to use myChEMBL:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>No Costs</strong> - myChEMBL uses open source tools and libraries, so it removes the expensive licensing costs often associated with similar applications.</li>
              <li><strong>Security</strong> - myChEMBL runs locally behind a firewall, therefore the typical concerns regarding the submission of sensitive data to web-based applications do not apply.</li>
              <li><strong>Application Development</strong> - the source code is available for all myChEMBL applications, so developers can use this as a starting point for applications they wish to develop in the future.</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Technical Usage</strong> - you can quickly get up and running using myChEMBL with no prior programming experience or SQL knowledge. Best place to start is the <a href="/mychembl/app/home.php">myChEMBL Web Interface</a></li>
              <li><strong>Learning</strong> - myChEMBL provides a versatile platform for learning chemical data mining and cheminformatics in an intuitive and straighford way. The combination of data with relevant pre-installed tools effectively lowers the 'activation barrier' and shifts the focus to hands-on programming and learning.</li>
              <li><strong>Training</strong> - myChEMBL is a great resource for training scientists on the use of essential tools in the field of drug discovery. Feel free to add your own tools and services and use in your own training courses - we would love to hear from you if you do this.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;Who is using myChEMBL?</h4>
          <p>We (the ChEMBL group) are using myChEMBL for training purposes and we are aware of many other academic and industrial users who have started using the system. We would like to hear from the community, so if you are using myChEMBL please <a href="mailto:mychembl@ebi.ac.uk">let us know</a>.</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;What is the difference between the <a href="/chemblws/docs/">Web Services hosted on myChEMBL</a> and the official <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ws">ChEMBL Web Services</a>?</h4>
          <p>Both sets of Web Services use the same codebase and expose the same set of methods to the end user, so they can be considered functionally identical. Please note the official ChEMBL Web Web Services use an Oracle database and the Accelrys Direct chemical cartridge, where as the myChEMBL Web Services use a PostrgreSQL database and the RDKit chemical cartridge. This change may lead to different chemical search results being returned.</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;What is the difference between the <a href="/mychembl/app/home.php">myChEMBL Web Interface</a> and the official <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">ChEMBL Web Interface</a>?</h4>
          <p>The myChEMBL Web Interface is completely independent from the official ChEMBL Web Interface and was developed by Rodrigo Ochoa during an internship with the ChEMBL group. The aim of the myChEMBL Web Interface is to provide users with an application, which demonstrates the chemical search functionality of the RDKit chemical cartridge, without any prior programming or SQL experience. The underlying codebase can be accessed here: <a href="https://github.com/chembl/mychembl_webapp">https://github.com/chembl/mychembl_webapp</a>.</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;Do you plan to include the official <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">ChEMBL Web Interface</a> with future releases of myChEMBL?</h4>
          <p>We have no plans to include the existing ChEMBL Web Interface with myChEMBL, this is mainly due to portability issues. We do plan an update of the official ChEMBL Web Interface and when this does happen it will become part of the myChEMBL distribution.</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;Can you provide some more details on the ChEMBL database?</h4>
          <p>Have a look at the <a href="/assets/img/chembl_18_schema.png">ChEMBL schema diagram</a> to get an idea of the data captured in the database and how the tables join together. You can then start using the <a href="phppgadmin">phpPgAdmin Interface</a> to query the database directly with SQL. (Note the schema diagram does not include the RDKit tables - see next question)</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;Are there any differences between the 'core' ChEMBL release database schema and the myChEMBL database schema?</h4>
          <p>Yes, after we have installed the RDKit cartridge we create 2 additional tables, which are:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>mols_rdkit</strong> - contains the ChEMBL molecules RDKit representation in the column named 'm'.</li>
              <li><strong>fps_rdkit</strong> - contains six fingerprint representations of the ChEMBL molecules created using RDKit. For more details on the RDKit fingerprints please visit <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rdkit/wiki/FingerprintsInTheRDKit">this page</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            Also, the <a href="/chemblws/docs/">Web Services hosted on myChEMBL</a> and the <a href="/mychembl/app/home.php">myChEMBL Web Interface</a> creates a number of temporary tables used to cache results. The Web Services use a table called <strong>ws_cache</strong> and the web interface uses a series of tables, whose names match the following pattern <strong>octmp_*</strong>. These tables can be ignored, but if disk space on the virtual machine does become limited, you may wish to truncate the <strong>ws_cache</strong> table using the following SQL:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <pre class="pre-scrollable">TRUNCATE TABLE ws_cache;</pre>
          </p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;Can you provide some more details on the ChEMBL group?</h4>
          <p>Visiting the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/">ChEMBL website</a> will provide you with links to all the projects the ChEMBL group is involved with. You may also be interested in following the <a href="http://chembl.blogspot.co.uk/">ChEMBL-og</a> and signing up to the <a href="http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/chembl-announce">ChEMBL mailing list</a>.</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>&nbsp;Is there a reference for myChEMBL?</h4>
